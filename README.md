rails-app-generator
===================

In the beginners workshop students would use that generator to bootstrap resources in their first Rails app.
The generator would add comments targeted at Rails Girls students to migrations, routes, controllers, models and views etc. Like a mini-inline tutorial that explains things briefly and gives pointers to guides or other resources. It would also omit more advanced things (like the respond_to blocks and json stuff in controllers etc.)
